Suppose for any class $Y$, we have a probability distribution over all possible combinations of values for a feature vector $X$:\n","$$\n","P(X|Y).\n","$$\n","The main idea of Bayesian classification is to reverse the direction of dependence --- we want to predict the label based on the features:\n","$$\n","P(Y|X).\n","$$\n","This is made possible by the Bayes theorem:\n","\\begin{equation}\n","P(Y|X) = \\frac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X)}. \\tag{1}\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","To make it more concrete, let us consider the SMS message classification problem. Ignoring punctuations, each SMS message contains an ordered sequence of $T$ words (case-insensitive) $X = \\{X_1, ...,X_T\\}$. That is, $X$ corresponds to an SMS message, and $X_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th word in it. For each message from the training set, there is a corresponding label $Y\\in\\{spam, ham\\}$. \n","\n","**Model specification and key assumption.** The conditional distribution can be written as:\n","$$\n","P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y).\n","$$\n","Since this conditional probability is intractable, we simplify it in two steps:\n","\n","1. **Assume** that all features $X_i$ are independent, conditional on the category $Y$. This leads to a naive Bayes model which writes formally as\n","\\begin{equation}\n","P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y) = \\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y). \\tag{2}\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","2. **Assume** that $P(X_i | Y) = P(X_j|Y)$ for all $i \\neq j$.\n","In other words, given the label $Y$, the value of the $7$-th word has the same distribution as the value of the $10$-th word. Note this is not assumed by default in naive Bayes, and we make this additional assumption to significantly simplify our model.\n","It is often referred to as \"tying\" the probability $P(X_i|Y)$ over $i$.\n","As a result, the order of words no longer matters for $P(X|Y)$,\n","i.e., \n","$$P(X=\\text{'cat is cute'}|Y) \\ \\ = \\ \\ P(X=\\text{'cute cat is'}|Y) \\quad \\text{for all } Y.\n","$$\n","\n","Plugging Eq (2) into the Bayes theorem in Eq (1), we arrive at\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","P(Y|X) &= \\frac{P(Y) P(X|Y)}{P(X)} = \\frac{P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y)}{P(X)} \\\\\n","&\\propto P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y),\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","where $\\propto$ denotes proportionality.

This is consistent with our previous note that we carry the subscript $i$ in $P(X_i|Y)$ only for clarity, while in fact different $i$ share the same $P(X_i|Y)$.\n","\n","For example, suppose there are four messages \n","$$\n","\\text{{'cat is cute', ham}, {'dog rocks', spam}, {'whatever is is right', ham}, {'hello', spam}.}\n","$$\n","Then $P(X_i = '\\text{is}' | \\text{ham}) = 3 / 7$ (**not** $2/7$),\n","and $P(X_i = '\\text{is}' | \\text{spam}) = 0 / 3$.\n","\n","Quiz (no need to submit): compute $P(X_i = w | \\text{ham})$, for $w = $ 'cat', 'is', 'cute', 'whatever', and 'right'.
